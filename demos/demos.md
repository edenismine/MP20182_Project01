## Module demos

Demos how a sandwich store would work under certain circumstances.

## Demo 1

Makes each clerk prepare a random menu item from their store. The
supervisor replenishes all the stores’ inventories afterwards.

## Demo 2

It makes the clerks from Main St and Lime Drv prepare the same sandwich.
Since the clerk at Mains St works at a tortería he shouldn't add a discount
to the sandwich, but the clerk from Lime Drv should. The supervisor
replenishes all the stores’ inventories afterwards.

# Package com.tormenteddan.demos

Package that contains the application that can run the demos. It works
with three sandwich stores (each one has a clerk as well) and a
supervisor.
